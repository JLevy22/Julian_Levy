Lesson 4. Return Functions:

Return functions give back a value when called, this value can be printed/used in another function/calculation
Ex. def cube(side):
	return(side**3)
    side = int(input("Enter side length of cube:"))
    print ("Your cube is ",cube(side), "cubic inches")

Instead of printing the function, the return value from outside is printed.
This can also be used for formatting:

Ex. def format(number):
	ouptput = "{:5.5f}".format(number)
	return output
    num1= 1/3
    print (format(num1))


Lesson 4. Variable Scope:
Scope: the areas of the program in which a specific variable is callable, which functions are able to use the variable
Scope is determined by levels of ., if a function is declared the code statements for that function must be underneath the function definition
Variables are only callable within the function they were created in.
Global Variables are declared at the beginning(top) of a program and have no indentation. These variables are useable anywhere in the program.
