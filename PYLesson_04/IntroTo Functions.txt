Intro to Functions:
programs are made of many smaller programs working together
creating a new function is called defining a function: def functionName ()
function paramenters allow you to pass data into the function from outside: def functionName (<parameters>)
                                                                              #statement 1
                                                                              #statement 2
                                                                              etc.
