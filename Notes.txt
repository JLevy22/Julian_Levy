Lesson 1 Notes: Escape Characters in Python

The backslash (\) character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning

Ex:
\newline = Ignored
\\ = Backslash (\)
\' = Single quote (')
\" = Double quote (")
\a = ASCII Bell (BEL)
\b = ASCII Backspace (BS)
\f = ASCII Formfeed (FF)
\n = ASCII Linefeed (LF)
\r = ASCII Carriage Return (CR)
\t = ASCII Horizontal Tab (TAB)
\v = ASCII Vertical Tab (VT)
\ooo = 	ASCII character with octal value ooo
\xhh... = ASCII character with hex value hh..

When the prefix 'r' or 'R' is present the backslash will be left in the string
